## Clustering Algorithms: K-Means

K-Means is the most basic of unsupervised clustering algorithms, very useful even in business settings, such as to do customer segmentation, basic fraud/anomaly detection, etc..

In this notebook, I will go through the steps required to implement the K-Means algorithm, as well as certain techniques to improve performance.

Although there are already existing libraries (SK-Learn) that have a really efficient implementation, building it from scratch will give much better inuitions on its strengths and shortcomings.
